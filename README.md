## Project Portfolio 
## Data Visualization in Power BI 
In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Adidas US sales dataset to present an Executive Overview and Product Data Analysis. The report highlights trends in total sales, profitability, sales volume, average price, and operating margin. The main tool used for the analysis is Power BI, utilizing dummy data generated via a Python script to evaluate performance and trends in the sales

## Financial Reporting and Analysis in Power BI


**Introduction**

This was a YouTube challenge I participated in with the assistance of the Zefas BI and Analytics channel on YouTube. The dataset was provided by Zefas BI as an Excel sheet in the form of a trial balance, mapping various FSLI items, with a primary focus on PL line items.

**Background**

This report leverages DAX functions to deliver an in-depth analysis of the key financial performance indicators (KPIs) for a fitness company. The report provides valuable insights into revenue, profitability, operational efficiency, and growth trends, with a focus on:

Revenue KPIs: Total Revenue, Revenue by Business Line, Revenue by Income Group, Revenue Growth Rate, and Revenue by Month.

Profitability KPIs: Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin, EBIT, EBIT Margin, Net Profit, and Net Profit Margin.

Cost-related / Operational Efficiency KPIs: Total COGS, COGS as a Percentage of Revenue, COGS by Business Line, Total OPEX, OPEX as a Percentage of Revenue, OPEX by Expense Subgroup, Interest and Tax Expenses.

Growth and Trend KPIs: Month-over-Month (MoM) Revenue and MoM Expense.

Budget Variance: Comparison of actual revenue and expenses against the targets set for the year, highlighting variances and performance gaps.

The report also analyzes the quarterly Profit and Loss statement for each of the three business lines, breaking down revenue and expense categories to assess financial perfomamance

**Insights**

**Revenue and ExpenseOverview**

The company achieved a total revenue of $17.56M for the year, with strong performances across its three primary business lines:

Sports Equipment: The top performer, generating $8.9M, or 50.68% of total revenue, exceeding its $6M target.

Sportswear: Contributed $6.81M, or 38.77% of total revenue, also surpassing its $6M target.

N&F Supplements: Generated $1.84M, representing 10.47% of total revenue, falling short of its $6M target.

These results highlight the strong performances of Sports Equipment and Sportswear, while emphasizing the need for improvement in the N&F Supplements segment.

Across all business lines, revenue was driven by three key streams: consulting and professional fees, other income, and sales.

N&F Supplements showed consistent performance throughout the year, with Q1 reaching a peak of $405,450 in consulting revenue. Consulting revenue for the company as a whole peaked in Q3. Sports Equipment recorded its highest sales in Q4, achieving $1,950,000. Sportswear saw its strongest performance in Q1, reaching $1,351,500, followed by a gradual decline in the following quarters. Both Sports Equipment and Sportswear experienced moderate additional income, with notable peaks in Q2 and Q4, respectively.

The expense statement reveals key insights into the cost structure across the company’s business lines:

N&F Supplements maintained stable COGS, peaking at $280,200 in Q2, with consistent interest and tax expenses throughout the year.

Operating Expenses (Opex) were highest in Q1 at $360,900, with a slight decrease by Q4.

Sports Equipment saw its highest COGS in Q2 at $954,200, along with fluctuating interest and tax expenses, which spiked to $119,500 in Q4.

Opex for Sports Equipment steadily increased, reaching $689,200 by Q4.

Sportswear experienced substantial COGS, peaking at $525,000 in Q2, while its Opex remained stable, ending at $434,000 in Q4.

These insights highlight the varying cost dynamics across business lines, with noticeable fluctuations in COGS and Opex, particularly in Sports Equipment.

The highest margins were seen in February (68%) and January (66%). May to June maintained relatively stable margins between 62% and 63%. September saw the lowest margin at 52%, but the year ended strong with December reaching 62%.
